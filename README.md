This project is to classify the nodes in a social network based on approximately10% of labeled nodes. The algorithm was designed inspired by KNN and implementedin Python.

This project was completed individually by Huilin Hu in Mar 2018. Due to confidentiality reasons, the link to original data is not uploaded here.

Part 1 of the file is to identify anomalous data based on client's criteria. Part 2 is to implement the algoritm (tested on small data first) to classify nodes in the network.
